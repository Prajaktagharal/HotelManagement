# HotelManagement

This project is a Java-based Hotel Room Management system that allows for the management of room availability, bookings, and cancellations. 
It provides a command-line interface for interaction.

Key Features:
1) Update Room Availability: Users can update the status (Available/Booked) of rooms for a specific date. The system prevents booking rooms for 
   past dates and notifies if a room is already booked on a given date. 
2) Cancel Booking: Users can cancel a room booking for a specific date and room number, changing its status back to "Available." 
3) Check Room Availability: Users can view the availability status of all rooms for a specified date. 
4) Display All Room Availability: The system can display a comprehensive list of all rooms and their availability status across different dates in a formatted table. 
5) Filter Rooms by Status: Users can filter and view rooms based on their status (Available or Booked) for a particular date. 
6) User-Friendly Interface: The system offers a menu-driven command-line interface for easy navigation and interaction. 
7) Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for invalid date formats.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
